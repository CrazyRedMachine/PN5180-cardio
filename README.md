# PN5180-cardio

PN5180 eAmusement wavepass USB HID card reader (cardio) with optional integrated keypad, ISO14443 to FeliCa spoof, Spiceapi integration 

# Acknowledgments

This work is based on zyp's cardio (obviously).

ISO15693 code is based on [ATrappmann/PN5180-Library](https://github.com/ATrappmann/PN5180-Library).

ISO14443 implementation taken from [tueddy/PN5180-Library/ISO14443](https://github.com/tueddy/PN5180-Library/tree/ISO14443).

HID layer code is inspired from Matthew Heironimus' <Joystick.h> library.

The keypad code uses the Keypad library by Mark Stanley and Alexander Brevig.

Spiceapi version provided by goat (thanks! :))

The spiceapi code uses the ArduinoJson library by Beno√Æt Blanchon.

# Supported devices

USBHID code has been tested on Arduino Due, Leonardo, and Pro Micro.

Arduino Due is recommended because it is 3.3v logic (or Pro Micro in 3.3v mode).
According to the PN5180 datasheet, a 5v<->3.3v level shifter is required
for use an Arduino Leonardo. However, I tested without it and everything
was working properly, and my PN5180 is not fried. I still recommend a Due
or a 3.3V pro micro just in case.

SPICEAPI code has been tested on Arduino UNO.
It should support any SPI-capable arduino without native USB HID capabilities but might require fine-tuning
`SPICEAPI_WRAPPER_BUFFER_SIZE` and `SPICEAPI_WRAPPER_BUFFER_SIZE_STR` parameters in `PN5180-cardio.ino`.

# Pinout

Because PN5180 is an SPI device, some pins are constrained,

Arduino | Level Converter | PN5180 pin mapping:
--- | --- | ---
5V      |      <-->       |      5V
3.3V    |       <-->      |       3.3V
GND    |        <-->      |       GND
5V      | HV | .
GND     | GND (HV) | .
 .        |   LV              | 3.3V
  .      |    GND (LV)        | GND
SCK    | HV1 - LV1       | SCK
MISO      |     <---        | MISO
MOSI    | HV3 - LV3       | MOSI
10   | HV4 - LV4      | NSS (=Not SS -> active LOW)
9  |       <---     |        BUSY
7 | HV2 - LV2      | RST

Please refer to your Arduino pinout to find SCK, MISO and MOSI pins
(on Due and Leonardo they are on the SPI / ICSP header, on Pro Micro
they are pins 15 (SCK),14 (MISO),16 (MOSI))

Unlike the other pins, NSS BUSY and RST can be moved to other gpios
if you need to.

# Keypad Pinout

Connect the row pins to gpio 1 6 5 3.
Connect the column pins to gpio 2 0 4.

If you want to use the keypad, you have to set `#define WITH_KEYPAD 1` in PN5180-cardio.ino in the top header options.

If you're using the USBHID mode, then you should also install Keypad library by Stanley and Brevig (can be installed directly from Arduino IDE library manager).

In SPICEAPI mode, it will work through Spiceapi instead.

# How to use

## USBHID

- Download zip
- (optional) set `#define WITH_KEYPAD 1` (in PN5180-cardio.ino user configurable options) and install Keypad library by Stanley and Brevig directly from Arduino IDE
- flash the firmware
- unplug the arduino
- connect the PN5180 and keypad to the Arduino.

Congratulations, your device should work just like a real cardio, use 
your favorite tools instructions to play (e.g. `spicetools -cardio`).

The keypad should be recognized as an additional USB device.

## SPICEAPI

- Download zip
- set `#define WITH_SPICEAPI 1` (in PN5180-cardio.ino user configurable options) and install ArduinoJson library by Blanchon directly from Arduino IDE
- set `SPICEAPI_PASS` accordingly (in PN5180-cardio.ino user configurable options)
- (optional) set `#define WITH_KEYPAD 1` (in PN5180-cardio.ino user configurable options) and install Keypad library by Stanley and Brevig directly from Arduino IDE
- flash the firmware
- unplug the arduino
- connect the PN5180 and keypad to the Arduino.

Congratulations, your device should work, run `spicetools -apiserial COMx` (with `x` your arduino COM port number).
